# Query-Processor
This project is a part of the CSE 332 (Data Structures and Parallelism) course and involves the development of a parallel query processor application in Java. 
The project was completed between July 2022 and August 2022.
# Desciption
In this project, we designed and implemented a parallel query processor application using Java, making use of Java's ForkJoin framework and multithreading capabilities. 
The primary goal was to efficiently process CSV datasets and demonstrate proficiency in optimizing
data processing tasks through parallelization strategies.
